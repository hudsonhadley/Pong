A pong game in python using pygame. It should be noted that the bulk of this
game was not created by me. The only thing created by me are the hard_ai and
moderate_ai functions in pong_ai.py. The hard_ai is practically impossible to score
against, while the moderate_ai is hard, but not impossible. The moderate_ai tries
to simulate an actual human player instead of calculating the correct spot to go to.
